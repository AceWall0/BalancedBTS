# Binary Search Tree Viewer

A constructor of a Balanced Binary Tree with a pretty neat viewer

## What is it?
This is a college project from CEDERJ (UFF) that required me to create 
an implementation of a binary tree, and than, create an User Interface 
to visualize and interact with it.

Even though it is a pretty simple application, I made it with love
trying to leave both the code and the user experience pretty polished up,
even if this is my first completed application.

You can save and load files generated on it, navigate by the keyboard,
change themes and lots of other small things for a 'first program'.

## Filelist
```
- BalancedBSTSet.py
- README.md
- treeTK.py
- test_BalancedBSTSet.py
- themes.json
```

## How to run:
Just run the file `treeTK.py` directly or via command, like `python treeTK.py` .
It requires Python 3.6 or higher.
